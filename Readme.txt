GitHub provides a basic template for creating a README.md file, but you can also use specialized tools like [GitHub README Templates](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template) or manually craft a well-structured README. Hereâ€™s a sample README.md file using Markdown, which you can customize for your project:

# YOLO-Based Object Detection Project

This repository contains code and resources for a YOLO-based object detection project. The goal is to detect LicensePlates and glass objects in images using a custom-trained YOLO v9 model. This project is optimized for mid-range hardware, including Intel i5 13th generation processors and RTX 3050 4GB GPUs.

## Features

- **Object Detection:** Detects LicensePlates and glass objects.
- **Bounding Boxes:** Draws bounding boxes around detected objects.
- **Performance Optimization:** Efficiently runs on mid-range hardware.
- **Detailed Metrics:** Provides insights into detection performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (`cv2`)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Ultralytics YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) library

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy ultralytics
```

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### Running the Code

1. Place your images in the `test2` directory.
2. Run the detection script:

    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

3. The processed images with bounding boxes will be saved in the `output` directory.

## Model Training

### Dataset Preparation

Prepare a dataset with labeled images of LicensePlates and glass objects. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

### Training the Model

1. **Annotation:** Use tools like [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) for annotation.
2. **Configuration:** Modify YOLO v9 config file for your dataset (2 classes: LicensePlate and glass).
3. **Training Command:**

    ```bash
    yolo train data=your_data.yaml model=yolov9.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640
    ```

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjust as needed for optimal performance.

### Evaluating Performance

Evaluate the model using precision, recall, and mAP metrics. Visualize performance with graphs or charts for a comprehensive analysis.

## Performance Insights

### Hardware Utilization

- **Inference Time:** 72.7ms to 209.3ms per image, depending on size and object count.
- **Postprocessing Time:** Minimal delays ensure real-time application suitability.

### Visualizations

- **Inference Time vs. Image Resolution**
- **Object Count per Image**
- **Precision-Recall Curve**

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates YOLO's capabilities in detecting specific objects efficiently on mid-range hardware. You are encouraged to fork, experiment, and contribute to this project.
